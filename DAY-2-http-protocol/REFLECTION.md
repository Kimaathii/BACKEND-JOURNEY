# Day 1 - HTTP Server - Reflection

## What I Built Today
[I Learnt how set up HTTP server to listen to req and access it url and method and logically response with a status code, content type and body using req.writeHead and req.end, status code are divided into 3 categories 2XX, 4XX, 5XX.... 200, 201, 204 for success, create, delete success, 4XX client error- 400, 401, 403, 404 - for invalid request, unauthorize login , permission missing, not found. 5XX 500, 503 server error, unavailable server.....]
## Challenges I Faced
[ the concept of arrange logic to checking urls and methods...... learn that the url check approach mitigate repetition in checks]

## What I Learned
1. assigning status code to responds
2. logic to getting id, url and method from request
3. how to handle all types of http methods, GET, POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE

## Questions Still Unclear
[not yet i did try to manipulate things later]
