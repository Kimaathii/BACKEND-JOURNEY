# Day 2 - HTTP Reflection Lifecycle - Reflection

## What I Built Today
# Day 3: Request Lifecycle - Reflection

## Overview
This document reflects on the learning outcomes and practical implementations from Day 3 of the Backend Mastery course, focusing on the Request Lifecycle.

## Key Learnings

### Request Body Streaming
- Learned how to stream request body data
- Understanding of handling incoming data in chunks rather than waiting for complete payload
- Implementation of efficient memory management for large requests

## Hands-On Activities

### Topics Covered
1. **Request Lifecycle Fundamentals**
    - Understanding the complete flow of HTTP requests
    - Request parsing and processing stages
    - Response generation and delivery

2. **Request Body Streaming**
    - Implementing stream-based request handling
    - Working with readable streams
    - Handling data chunks and buffering
    - Managing backpressure in streams

3. **Practical Implementations**
    - Building middleware to process streaming data
    - Error handling in stream operations
    - Performance optimization techniques
    - Memory-efficient request processing

## Skills Developed
- Stream API usage in backend applications
- Efficient handling of large payload requests
- Understanding of asynchronous data processing
- Request lifecycle management best practices

## Next Steps
- Apply streaming concepts to real-world scenarios
- Explore advanced streaming patterns
- Optimize existing request handlers

## Challenges I Faced
[ i need to revisit promise async and await, try and catch and also using <> in typescript ]



## Questions Still Unclear
[i have many questions]

## Time Spent: [4 hours]
